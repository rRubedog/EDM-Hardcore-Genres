                    Camellia is an artist that is mainly appreciated through the rhythm game scene as one of the biggest producers for spesifically rhythm game created music.
                    Being a rhythm gamer myself, I'm a bit bias as he is my favorite artist aside from t+pazolite in the rhythm game scene.  He has made songs in many diffrent genres, some being Dubstep, Hardcore, Trap, Gabber, Drum n Bass, and Trance.
                    Camellia started producing music in 2010 and was born in 1992, with his most popular song having about 7.15M streams and 350+ monthly listeners he is one of the most respected and popular artists in the hardcore scene.
